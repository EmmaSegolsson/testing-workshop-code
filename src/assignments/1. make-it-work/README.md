# Make it work

This assignment is fairly straight forward. Starting from the top, your goal is to write test suites for each of the functions. Keep in mind to start with writing a test suite for the expected behaviours of the function, which would likely fail, then write the implementation to pass your tests.


### Commands
```bash
yarn test make-it-work
yarn test filtering
yarn test math
```
