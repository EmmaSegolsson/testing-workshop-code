# Hot Wheels Limited 

## Code Case
At hot wheels limited we make cars of various brands and models. Filtering and categorization of them is of utter importance as it is the foundation on which multiple of other functions and processes built upon.


Your assignment as a new developer is to build and ensure that the new `hotWheels` categorization function works as intended.

The `hotWheels` function expects two arguments which you can investigate in the file `hotWheels.ts`.

You are responsible to write two tests that should test if the hotWheels function can categorize cars by `manufacturer` and by `model`.

Each tests should follow the format:
1. Use the API to get the most recently created cars.
2. Use the hotWheels function to categorize by `manufacturer` or `model`.
3. Pass the result to the expect function and ensure that your function works as intended.


### Commands
```bash
yarn test hot-wheels
